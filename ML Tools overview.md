YOLO (You Only Look Once)
How YOLO Works: YOLO is a real-time object detection system that applies a single neural network to the full image. The network divides the image into regions and predicts bounding boxes and probabilities for each region. These bounding boxes are weighted by the predicted probabilities.

Key Steps in YOLO:

Input Image: The image is divided into an ( S \times S ) grid.
Bounding Box Prediction: Each grid cell predicts a fixed number of bounding boxes. Each bounding box consists of four coordinates (x, y, width, height) and a confidence score.
Class Prediction: Each grid cell predicts the probability of each class.
Non-Max Suppression: YOLO applies non-max suppression to reduce the number of overlapping boxes, keeping the most confident ones.
Output: YOLO outputs the bounding boxes with class labels and confidence scores.
Advantages of YOLO:

Speed: YOLO is very fast because it processes the entire image with a single forward pass of the network.
Accuracy: YOLO achieves high accuracy for object detection tasks.
Unified Model: YOLO uses a single network for both classification and localization, simplifying the architecture.
Real World Example: Using YOLO to identify pictures on walls in a dataset of interior room images involves training the YOLO model with annotated images where pictures on the walls are labeled. The trained model can then detect and identify pictures in new images of interior rooms.
