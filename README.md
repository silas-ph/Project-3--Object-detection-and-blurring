Time Frame: 2 weeks
Phase 2: Data Acquisition and Preprocessing
Task 2.1: Extract Frames from Video
Description: Develop a script to break down the video into individual frames.
Time Frame: 1 week
Task 2.2: Data Collection and Annotation
Description: Collect sample videos from mobile phones (both Apple and Android) and annotate the frames using LabelImg.
Time Frame: 2 weeks
Task 2.3: Data Augmentation
Description: Augment the dataset to improve model robustness (e.g., rotation, scaling, flipping).
Time Frame: 1 week
Phase 3: Model Development
Task 3.1: Develop Picture Detection Model
Description: Train a model (e.g., YOLOv5, Faster R-CNN) to detect pictures on walls.
Time Frame: 4 weeks
Task 3.2: Develop Countertop Detection Model
Description: Train a model to detect countertops in the images.
Time Frame: 4 weeks

Description: Train a model to detect objects on countertops (e.g., bottles, personal items).
Time Frame: 4 weeks
Phase 4: Model Evaluation and Optimization
Task 4.1: Evaluate Models
Description: Evaluate the performance of the detection models using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and mean Average Precision (mAP).
Time Frame: 2 weeks
Task 4.2: Optimize Models
Description: Optimize model parameters and retrain if necessary to improve performance to an accuracy level of 85% or higher.
Time Frame: 2 weeks
