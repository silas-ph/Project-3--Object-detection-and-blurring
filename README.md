Business Problem: 
MVP- Videos captured by insureds will have sensitive and personally identifiable information.  The goal is to indentify geometric shapes on walls (pictures, deplomas, art work) and then blurr each one.  The second objective is to identify prescription pill bottles and then blur them.

Stretch Goals:  Process vidoes and convert the videos into pictures, apply the blurring and then combine the blurred images with the 3D model of each room.


To create a system for image identification and blurring, we will need to combine several machine learning technologies and algorithms. Below are the key components and machine learning technologies required for this project:

### 1. **Object Detection Neural Networks**

**YOLO (You Only Look Once):**
- **Description**: A real-time object detection system that processes the entire image in a single forward pass.
- **Usage**: YOLO can detect objects within an image, providing bounding boxes and class probabilities.
- **Advantages**: High speed and accuracy for real-time applications.

**Faster R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks):**
- **Description**: An object detection model that uses a region proposal network (RPN) to propose regions of interest and then classifies them.
- **Usage**: Detecting objects and generating precise bounding boxes.
- **Advantages**: High accuracy and good for applications where precision is more important than speed.

**SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector):**
- **Description**: A single-stage object detection network that predicts bounding boxes and class scores in a single forward pass.
- **Usage**: Detecting objects in images, similar to YOLO but with a different architecture.
- **Advantages**: Balances speed and accuracy.

### 2. **Image Segmentation Networks**

**Mask R-CNN:**
- **Description**: An extension of Faster R-CNN that adds a branch for predicting segmentation masks on each Region of Interest (RoI).
- **Usage**: Identifying and segmenting objects within images, providing pixel-level precision.
- **Advantages**: Useful for tasks that require precise boundaries of objects.

### 3. **Image Processing for Blurring**

**OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library):**
- **Description**: A library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision.
- **Usage**: Applying blurring techniques to specific regions in images.
- **Blurring Techniques**:
  - **Gaussian Blur**: Applies a Gaussian kernel to the image, useful for smooth blurring.
  - **Median Blur**: Replaces each pixelâ€™s value with the median of its neighboring pixels.
  - **Bilateral Filter**: Preserves edges while blurring.

### 4. **Pre-trained Models and Frameworks**

**Hugging Face Transformers:**
- **Description**: A library that provides pre-trained models for various NLP and vision tasks.
- **Usage**: Leveraging pre-trained models for object detection or image classification tasks.

**TensorFlow and Keras:**
- **Description**: Popular machine learning libraries that provide tools for building and training neural networks.
- **Usage**: Implementing and training custom neural networks or using pre-trained models for object detection.

**PyTorch:**
- **Description**: An open-source machine learning library based on the Torch library.
- **Usage**: Building, training, and deploying machine learning models.

### 5. **Data Augmentation and Preprocessing**

**ImageDataGenerator (Keras):**
- **Description**: A tool for real-time data augmentation in Keras.
- **Usage**: Augmenting training images to improve model generalization.
- **Techniques**:
  - Rotation
  - Width and Height Shift
  - Shear
  - Zoom
  - Horizontal and Vertical Flip

**Albumentations:**
- **Description**: A fast image augmentation library.
- **Usage**: Applying complex and customizable augmentation pipelines.

### 6. **Annotation Tools**

**LabelImg:**
- **Description**: An open-source graphical image annotation tool.
- **Usage**: Annotating images with bounding boxes for training object detection models.

**VGG Image Annotator (VIA):**
- **Description**: A simple and standalone manual annotation software for image, audio, and video.
- **Usage**: Annotating images with bounding boxes or segmentation masks.



1. **Data Collection and Annotation**:
   - Collect a dataset of images of interior rooms.
   - Annotate images using tools like LabelImg or VIA to create bounding boxes around pictures on walls and other items to be blurred.

2. **Data Augmentation**:
   - Use `ImageDataGenerator` or `Albumentations` to augment the dataset and improve model generalization.

3. **Model Selection and Training**:
   - Choose a pre-trained object detection model like YOLO, Faster R-CNN, or Mask R-CNN.
   - Fine-tune the model on the annotated dataset.

4. **Object Detection**:
   - Apply the trained model to detect objects in new images.
   - Use the bounding box coordinates to identify regions containing pictures and other sensitive items.

5. **Image Blurring**:
   - Use OpenCV to apply Gaussian blur or other blurring techniques to the detected regions.
   - Example code for blurring:
     ```python
     import cv2

     def blur_image(image, bounding_boxes):
         for box in bounding_boxes:
             x1, y1, x2, y2 = box
             roi = image[y1:y2, x1:x2]
             blurred_roi = cv2.GaussianBlur(roi, (51, 51), 30)
             image[y1:y2, x1:x2] = blurred_roi
         return image
     ```

6. **Integration with LLM for Enhanced Functionality** (Optional):
   - Use an LLM like GPT-4 to provide contextual analysis or generate natural language explanations for detected objects.
